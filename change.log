== 4-22-15 ==
+ Added Change.log!

== Initial (from readme.md) ==
+ Users can login with their email address and password
+ Users can post a link with a title to firebase
+ The navbar can be used to logout, and is ready to link to the user profile.
+ User posts work as intended.
+ User profiles are complete, except for user avatar uploading.
+ Replies work properly now.
- Reply counts aren't working yet, but I think a filter MAY be the answer... 
+ Timestamp elements are now clickable, and work as a rudimentary search option.
+ Avatars are clickable, and load the user's profile. 
- User profiles need to show the user's post count and reply count. 
= The navbar will show any new comments left for a user. Not functional yet.
= Also need to make the post queue service, and link to the 'more posts' button.
= Also also need to condense post.content down to post.preview, to control the height of he container.
= The back-end libraries are reorganized, and migrating away from the boilerplate.

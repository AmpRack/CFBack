== 5-02-15 ==
! New branch 'fb-update' created.
! Firebase has been updated from 1.6.3 to 2.2.4. AngularFire updated from 0.8.2 to 1.0.0.
? Lot of changes to the Firebase api, which means a lot of rewriting. Every file needs to be checked, tested, and fixed. 
+ Login, Registration, Logout, and some posting functions work properly.


== 4-29-15 ==
+ Libraries updated to include imgur api settings and new app name (Conclave)
+ Lots of code cleanup from the last update
+ Bugfixes to profile controller

== 4-28-15 ==
+ Post service now refers to user profiles for info, instead of attaching it to every post.
+ Reply methods are slightly more separate from Post methods, for better control
+ Fixed several profile bugs, regarding multiple user handling
+ Posts and replies now carry less data, in general
- Reply counting is getting a new method, but isn't working right yet. 
? Firebase rules are working properly, but may need a once-over.


== 4-25-15 ==  
+ Users can now change their password (works, needs error handling)
+ Users can also upload pictures to their profile

== 4-22-15 ==
+ Added Change.log!
+ Users can now request a temporary password if they lose/forget their own.
+ Users can now track how many posts and replies they've made.
- Post/Reply counts are incremental only; deleting does NOT decrease the counts.
+ Posts now have individual reply counts.
= New account registration moved to the landing page, as a modal
+ Minor bugfixes and code cleanup all around.



== Initial (from readme.md) ==
+ Users can login with their email address and password
+ Users can post a link with a title to firebase
+ The navbar can be used to logout, and is ready to link to the user profile.
+ User posts work as intended.
+ User profiles are complete, except for user avatar uploading.
+ Replies work properly now.
- Reply counts aren't working yet, but I think a filter MAY be the answer... 
+ Timestamp elements are now clickable, and work as a rudimentary search option.
+ Avatars are clickable, and load the user's profile. 
- User profiles need to show the user's post count and reply count. 
= The navbar will show any new comments left for a user. Not functional yet.
= Also need to make the post queue service, and link to the 'more posts' button.
= Also also need to condense post.content down to post.preview, to control the height of he container.
= The back-end libraries are reorganized, and migrating away from the boilerplate.
! Database and auth system were reset on April 8th! Please re-register your account.

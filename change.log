== 6-03-15 ==
+ Comment notifier complete, fully functional.
! Merged 'fb-update' branch to master.
+ Search function integrated.
+ Post windows widened, to fill out the page better
! Fixed bug regarding disappearing usernames.
~ Various style bugfixes and cleanup. All previously mentioned style changes have been addressed.


== 5-28-15 ==
+ Comment notifier is FINALLY starting to work properly. Prototype button detects new replies, and links them to the profile page.
> Overall, the whole thing needs a styling facelift. The alert button needs a dismissal button (that marks all unread replies as read), the reply counter and the view-post button need to be more user-friendly. Posts with new replies should have a bright border around them on the profile page, amongst all of their posts. This will be in the second update.


== 5-25-15 ==
+ Replies are now properly trackable. Users are notified whenever a user leaves the reply to any of the user's posts.
- While all the information is being tracked properly, the button itself needs to be plugged in (route to profile, change $scope.posts)
+ Profile controller and view updated to more closely match the main controller/view. 
+ Bug Fixes: Modals now close properly (no resizing or refreshing needed to force a fix)
~ While most bugs regarding $scope data loss have been fixed, there is one small edge case: Viewing your own post, then NOT clicking the close button leads to disappearing profile info. Again, it's not permanently lost, just removed from scope.
+ Updated some bower/package settings, and finally removed the Firebase Simple Login modules.
! A lot of post sorting functions need to be changed into filters, but they all work fine for now.


== 5-14-15 ==
+ Firebase update integration is complete. Everything is re-hooked up and working.
+ Post service update! Replies are now stored as part of the post object. Cuts down on queries and bandwidth.
+ Reply counts and post counts all work properly.
~ Libraries.rar reduced to node_modules.rar. All other files/folders moved to Github as-is.
- New bug: When leaving a reply, author.username disappears from other, previous replies in the same post. Any further changes to the $scope or $route fix it.


== 5-02-15 ==
! New branch 'fb-update' created.
! Firebase has been updated from 1.6.3 to 2.2.4. AngularFire updated from 0.8.2 to 1.0.0.
? Lot of changes to the Firebase api, which means a lot of rewriting. Every file needs to be checked, tested, and fixed. 
+ Login, Registration, Logout, and some posting functions work properly.


== 4-29-15 ==
+ Libraries updated to include imgur api settings and new app name (Conclave)
+ Lots of code cleanup from the last update


== 4-28-15 ==
+ Post service now refers to user profiles for info, instead of attaching it to every post.
+ Reply methods are slightly more separate from Post methods, for better control
+ Fixed several profile bugs, regarding multiple user handling
+ Posts and replies now carry less data, in general
- Reply counting is getting a new method, but isn't working right yet. 
? Firebase rules are working properly, but may need a once-over.


== 4-25-15 ==  
+ Users can now change their password (works, needs error handling)
+ Users can also upload pictures to their profile

== 4-22-15 ==
+ Added Change.log!
+ Users can now request a temporary password if they lose/forget their own.
+ Users can now track how many posts and replies they've made.
- Post/Reply counts are incremental only; deleting does NOT decrease the counts.
+ Posts now have individual reply counts.
= New account registration moved to the landing page, as a modal
+ Minor bugfixes and code cleanup all around.



== Initial (from readme.md) ==
+ Users can login with their email address and password
+ Users can post a link with a title to firebase
+ The navbar can be used to logout, and is ready to link to the user profile.
+ User posts work as intended.
+ User profiles are complete, except for user avatar uploading.
+ Replies work properly now.
- Reply counts aren't working yet, but I think a filter MAY be the answer... 
+ Timestamp elements are now clickable, and work as a rudimentary search option.
+ Avatars are clickable, and load the user's profile. 
- User profiles need to show the user's post count and reply count. 
= The navbar will show any new comments left for a user. Not functional yet.
= Also need to make the post queue service, and link to the 'more posts' button.
= Also also need to condense post.content down to post.preview, to control the height of he container.
= The back-end libraries are reorganized, and migrating away from the boilerplate.
